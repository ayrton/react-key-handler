## Installation

```sh
$ npm install react-key-handler --save
```

## Usage

You can use `react-key-handler` library in two flavours:

- [higher-order components](#higher-order-components)
- [component](#component)

### Higher-order Components

This library includes two similar higher-order components, but with a different puprose:

| Higher-order Component | Purpose             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| `keyHandler`           | Handles key changes |
| `keyToggleHandler`     | Handles key toggles |

Both have the same API and will decorate the given component with a `keyValue`, `code`
and `keyCode` property.

Internally the `KeyHandler` component is used, for a full understanding be sure to
check out [the implementation](lib/key-handler.js).

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { keyHandler, KEYPRESS } from 'react-key-handler';

function Demo({ keyValue }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {keyValue === 's' && (
        <ol>
          <li>hello</li>
          <li>world</li>
        </ol>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default keyHandler({ keyEventName: KEYPRESS, keyValue: 's' })(Demo);
```

The prop types of the `KeyHandler` component are:

| Name            | Type   | Required   | Default   |                                        |
| --------------- | ------ | ---------- | --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| keyEventName    | string | no         | `'keyup'` | `'keydown'`, `'keypress'` or `'keyup'` |
| keyValue        | string | yes **\*** |           | Any given [KeyboardEvent.key]          |
| code            | string | yes **\*** |           | Any given [KeyboardEvent.code]         |
| keyCode&dagger; | number | yes **\*** |           | Any given [KeyboardEvent.keyCode]      |

**\*** You should pass at least one of these props.

&dagger; _Note_ that the keyCode is frequently browser specific and has therefore be set as
deprecated, see [MDN for details](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/keyCode).

[Examples](demo/components/examples/decorators/)

### Component

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import KeyHandler, { KEYPRESS } from 'react-key-handler';

export default class Demo extends React.Component {
  state = { showMenu: false };

  render() {
    const { showMenu } = this.state;

    return (
      <React.Fragment>
        <KeyHandler
          keyEventName={KEYPRESS}
          keyValue="s"
          onKeyHandle={this.toggleMenu}
        />

        {showMenu && (
          <ol>
            <li>hello</li>
            <li>world</li>
          </ol>
        )}
      </React.Fragment>
    );
  },

  toggleMenu = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();

    this.setState({ showMenu: !this.state.showMenu });
  };
}
```

The prop types of the `KeyHandler` component are:

| Name            | Type     | Required   | Default   |                                                  |
| --------------- | -------- | ---------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| keyEventName    | string   | no         | `'keyup'` | `'keydown'`, `'keypress'` or `'keyup'`           |
| keyValue        | string   | yes **\*** |           | Any given [KeyboardEvent.key]                    |
| code            | string   | yes **\*** |           | Any given [KeyboardEvent.code]                   |
| keyCode&dagger; | number   | yes **\*** |           | Any given [KeyboardEvent.keyCode]                |
| onKeyHandle     | function | yes        |           | Function that is called when they key is handled |

**\*** You should pass at least one of these props.

&dagger; _Note_ that the keyCode is frequently browser specific and has therefore be set as
deprecated, see [MDN for details](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/keyCode).

[Example](demo/components/examples/component/index.js)

### Form key handling

This library does not handle key events for form elements such as `<input />` and `<textarea />`.

React does a fine job supporting these already via [keyboard events](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html#keyboard-events).

[Examples](demo/components/examples/input/)

## Key event names

TODO: explain the differences between the different key events.

## `keyValue`, `code` and `keyCode`

The three available key events are

- `keyValue` This corresponds to the true value. This is the value of the key pressed
  by the user while taking into considerations the state of modifier keys
  such as the `shiftKey` as well as the keyboard locale/layout
- `code` This corresponds to the physical key on the keyboard (as opposed to the
  character generated by pressing the key). In other words, this property
  returns a value which isn't altered by keyboard layout or the state of
  the modifier keys. The value is a string specific to the key, e.g. 'Digit0'
- `keyCode` This is similar to code but numeric and also _deprecated_.

We recommend you to use the new Web standard [KeyboardEvent.key] or the [KeyboardEvent.code]
over the deprecated [KeyboardEvent.keyCode].

Note that in **React** `key` is a reserved property, and thus we use `keyValue` when referring
to the `key` property.

**Browser support:**

There's no need to worry about browser support because internally we normalize
deprecated HTML5 `keyValue` values and translate from legacy `keyCode` values,
similar to how React does this for their `SyntheticKeyboardEvent`.

## Development

### Setup

```sh
$ git clone <this repo>
$ cd react-key-handler
$ npm install
```

### Getting started

To start the server:

```sh
$ npm demo
```

This starts a development server, which will automatically rebuild the demo app as you change files and supports hot module replacement for fast development:

```sh
$ open http://localhost:1234
```

### Tests

To run all tests:

```sh
$ npm test
```

Or you can run the linters, unit tests and check for type errors individually:

```sh
$ npm run test:lint
$ npm run test:unit
$ npm run test:flow
```
